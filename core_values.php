						We promise to follow these core values, asking for forgiveness when we fall short, and seeking the Spirit's help to better live by them in the future.
					</p>

					<h4>Faith</h4>
					<p>
						We believe our mission starts with God, is led by the Spirit, and is completed through God's power. We aim to base our understanding and actions on Scripture. We follow Jesus' example by showing God's love to those we serve. We pray for the Holy Spirit's guidance and strive to live out our faith in everything we do.
					</p>

					<h4>Service</h4>
					<p>
						Jesus met people's needs in all areas of life. We share the message of Jesus in ways that include speaking about the gospel, helping those in need, and caring for creation. We value integrity, stewardship, honesty, transparency, and accountability in our work. We encourage creative and flexible responses to the Holy Spirit as we serve God, His people, and the world.
					</p>

					<h4>Community</h4>
					<p>
						God calls us to love and support each other in community. We care for everyone we work with, both those we serve and those who serve with us. We engage in mission by respecting the gifts and diversity of all our partners. We are committed to working with a variety of organizations, within and beyond the American Baptist movement, to fulfill God's call and our mission. We aim to build relationships of mutual giving and receiving.
