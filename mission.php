					<p>
						The general framework that underpins Global Ministries Daily Bread is the belief that everyone engaging in their roles does so as a calling or purpose of existence. This framework revolves around three steps: <strong>Character, Competence, and Calling</strong>, which correspond to the Church, College, and Company.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						At level one, we aim to transform individuals and communities through building churches in various locations.
					</p>

					<p>
						At level two, we establish educational institutions — from nurseries and primary schools to secondary schools, colleges, and universities.
					</p>

					<p>
						Level three focuses on leveraging acquired skills and qualifications to create jobs, support self-employment, and enhance employability. This includes technical training and skills development.
					</p>

					<p>
						The GBM Centre supports schools such as evangelical faith-based institutions, private universities, polytechnics, and technical colleges to equip graduates for self-reliance.
					</p>

					<p>
						To achieve these goals, we require financial resources and a committed workforce. Fixed assets — land, buildings, and infrastructure — are foundational to our long-term success.
					</p>

					<p>
						Our projects begin with a team of visionary individuals led by a competent visionaire who guides the process of implementation and transformation.
					</p>

					<p>
						Radio and TV programs, community rebuilding, tech and computer distribution, and transport infrastructure (buses, trains) are integral to our job creation and community service agenda.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-center">Our Vision</h2>
					
					<p>
						Global Ministries Daily Bread partners with Empowerment Missions International in a multilateral vision we call <strong>SEE</strong> — Socio-spiritual, Educational, and Economic Empowerment.
					</p>

					<h4>A) Socio-spiritual Empowerment</h4>
					<p>
						This is our first tier. We emphasize <strong>Character, Competency,</strong> and <strong>Calling</strong>. Without strong character, success is not sustainable. Our goal is to raise a generation grounded in hope, faith, and love — through holistic ministries centered around charity and empowerment.
					</p>

					<h4>B) Educational Empowerment</h4>
					<p>
						Tier two focuses on practical training based on talents and abilities. We aim to open doors globally, training individuals to serve with purpose through skill acquisition and competency development.
					</p>

					<h4>C) Economic Empowerment</h4>
					<p>
						The third tier aims at job creation and economic sustainability. Building on the foundation of character, we focus on humanitarian needs and seek to empower individuals who, in turn, empower others — creating a chain of transformation.
